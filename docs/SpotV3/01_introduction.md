# Introduction

## API Key Setup

- Some endpoints will require an API Key. Please refer to [this page](https://www.mexc.com/user/openapi) regarding API key creation.
- Once API key is created, it is recommended to set IP restrictions on the key for security reasons.
- Never share your API key/secret key to ANYONE.

If the API keys were accidentally shared, please delete them immediately and create a new key.

## API Key Restrictions

Check the required permissions when creating an API Key

## API Library

We provide developers with SDKs in five languages: Python, DotNET, Java, Javascript, and Go, and provide users with methods to call APIs directly through the SDK. Currently supports all interfaces in spot.
